NoScripts 0.9.2 August 20th, 2010
	New: Temporarily allow this feature.
	
	New: FTP sites embedded in iframes can now be blocked. FTP site HTML is generated by Google Chrome.
	New: Rewrote the url parser to be much more robust. Now also supports IPv6 in addition to IPv4 and text urls.
	New: IFrames are now allowed by default for better site compatibility and to fall in like with the default behavior of "NoScript" for Firefox. 
		You can force blocking of iframes by putting      const DO_NOT_BLOCK_IFRAMES = false;      into CHANGE__PASSWORD__HERE.js.
		Note that the scripts and plugins inside of an iframe are blocked normally.
	New: Placed a description into the NotScripts password file to help new users. Also removed the commented out options.
	New: There is some preliminary mitigation for inline scripts.
	New: The error message for the password status will now tell you if your password is too short.
	Change: NotScripts' own copy of settings now resides in only one place of the program instead of being reloaded for options/drop down menu.
	Workaround: Workaround for Google Chrome on netbooks with screen heights of less than 700px where the drop down menu is cut off by the screen. 
	Bug fix: Forced el.nodeName to upper case for checking in all cases (ie: for XHTML).
	Bug fix: (Reported by rEnr3n) Empty elements used to later load another source (and fire another load event) are now correctly allowed to be created.
	Clean: Removed all the preliminary code for Safari version so I can focus on Google Chrome.
	Add: Added paragraph in Limitations to say that NotScripts does not currently support the other advanced protection methods that NoScript for Firefox has.

	Todo: Show extension storage size and change extension alert when exceeded or no access.
		Binary search of sorted arrays instead of linear search for increased performance on large lists.
		Change: Changed the behavior of the "Globally Allow All Temporarily" button to only refresh the current tab instead of all tabs when toggled.
		Put in option to reload all or just the current page

NoScripts 0.9.1 August 18th, 2010
	Bug fix: (Reported by rEnr3n) Google Chrome may not fire storage change events when NotScripts initializes. 
		This can result in the "Revoke All Temporary" button not working for a session if you shut down Google Chrome with everything globally allowed.
	Bug fix: (Reported by rEnr3n) Improved the blocking compatibility for embed and object tags used on video sites.
	Bug fix: Duplicates of the same url from different iframes are now filtered to avoid cluttering the drop down menu.
	New: You can selectively turn off NotScript blocking for scripts, iframes, embeds, and objects by placing a special value in CHANGE__PASSWORD__HERE.js
	
NoScripts 0.9.0 August 17th, 2010
	First public version.
