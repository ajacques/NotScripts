NotScripts 0.9.2 August 24th, 2010
	Major release.
	New: Temporarily allow this features along with a redesigned drop down menu.
	
	New: FTP sites embedded in iframes can now be blocked. FTP site HTML is generated by Google Chrome.
	New: Rewrote the url parser to be much more robust. Now also supports IPv6 in addition to IPv4 and text urls.
		 However, I have turned IPv6 recognition off in the code until it is more widespread and more people are familiar with it.
	New: NotScripts can recognize localhost type urls like http://localhost/something.html.		 
		 Note that the "localhost" part is required to be at least 4 characters long.
	New: More compatible and sensible default blocking policy for iframes. 
		IFrames are now loaded only if the current website is whitelisted instead of requiring you to whitelist every site in an iframe.
		This allows you to use sites like StumbleUpon that uses iframes to load external websites 
			without having to whitelist the external sites or totally disable iframe blocking like in NotScripts V0.9.1.
		Please remove      const DO_NOT_BLOCK_IFRAMES = true;      in CHANGE__PASSWORD__HERE.js if you added that in NotScripts V0.9.1.
		Note that the scripts and plugins inside of an iframe are blocked normally.
	New: Placed a description into the NotScripts password file to help new users. Also removed the commented out options.
	New: There is some preliminary mitigation for inline scripts.
	New: The error message for the password status will now tell you if your password is too short.
	Change: NotScripts' own copy of settings now resides in only one place of the program instead of being reloaded for options/drop down menu.
	Change: Reloading of tabs after delisting/whitelisting now happens on all applicable tabs instead of only the current tab. Done for consistency.
	Workaround: (Reported by rEnr3n) Workaround for Google Chrome on netbooks with screen heights of less than 700px where the drop down menu is cut off by the screen. 
	Bug Fix: Forced el.nodeName to upper case for checking in all cases (ie: for XHTML).
	Bug Fix: (Reported by rEnr3n) Empty elements used to later load another source (and fire another load event) are now correctly allowed to be created.
	New: More complete removal of urls with unrecognized top level domains (TLD) from the whitelist when delisted. 
		For example, say .xyz is an unrecognized TLD, then if you had both sub1.example.xyz and example.xyz in your whitelist, 
		removing either one will also remove the other. 
		This is done to avoid having orphaned urls in the whitelist when more recognized TLDs are added to NotScripts.
		Also, whitelist sub1.example.xyz now means that example.xyz is also whitelisted since they come from the same primary domain.
	New: More intelligent display of urls with unrecognized TLDs to minimize multiple urls from the same domain.
	Clean: Removed all the preliminary code for Safari version so I can focus on Google Chrome.
	Add: Added paragraph in Limitations to say that NotScripts does not currently support the other advanced protection methods that NoScript for Firefox has.
	Add: Added recognition for the top level domains of .cn, .tv., .jp. .de, and .tw along with their secondary domains.

NotScripts 0.9.1 August 18th, 2010
	Bug fix: (Reported by rEnr3n) Google Chrome may not fire storage change events when NotScripts initializes. 
		This can result in the "Revoke All Temporary" button not working for a session if you shut down Google Chrome with everything globally allowed.
	Bug fix: (Reported by rEnr3n) Improved the blocking compatibility for embed and object tags used on video sites.
	Bug fix: Duplicates of the same url from different iframes are now filtered to avoid cluttering the drop down menu.
	New: You can selectively turn off NotScripts blocking for scripts, iframes, embeds, and objects by placing a special value in CHANGE__PASSWORD__HERE.js
	
NotScripts 0.9.0 August 17th, 2010
	First public version.
